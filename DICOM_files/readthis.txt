The DICOM_files folder is a '*.dcm' source folder for the DICOM files. 
This is the folder from which the 'DICOM_processor.get_metadata_list' takes the files in order to extract meta-data and order them in a hierarchical directory-tree.
Alternatively, you can download dcm files directly by calling the 'DICOM_processor.get_dcm_from_url' function with a downloadable url address.
Enjoy!
